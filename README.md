# Multi-var-proj1
Multivariable control systems mini-project 1

miniproj1.m contains a matlab script that runs that contains all the plots found in the project write up. Clicking run will model the electrical system, then plot all the figures shown in the report, though it may be easier to click through each section individually so it is clear which plot is being shown.

Feedback_control.slx is a simulink model that represents the closed loop feedback system. All parts of the lab that require the use of the closed loop system can be run from the matlab script without any changes to the simulink model.

RLC_circuit_solver.slx is a simscape model of the electrical circuit that I used to double check the circuit transfer function. It is not strictly necessary as all the math to model the system is done in miniproj1.m
